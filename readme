Jade embodies the profound cultural heritage and artistic value of Chinese civ-
ilization, making its digital preservation and transmission critically important.
However, automated analysis of jade imagery is hindered by significant chal-
lenges, including diverse morphological forms, intricate textures, and ambiguous
inter-class features. To address these issues, this study introduces JadeFormer,
a novel image retrieval model trained under the Graph Contrastive Momentum
(GCM) framework. The core of JadeFormer is a dynamic encoder built upon
an enhanced Swin Transformer, which incorporates a Compositional Window
Multi-Head Attention (CW-MHA) mechanism to facilitate efficient information
exchange between microscopic textures and macroscopic morphologies. To fur-
ther enhance sensitivity to jade-specific features, a Prior Feature Fusion Module
(PFFM) integrates a set of learnable prototypes that capture characteristic tex-
tures and shapes. The GCM framework utilizes an improved contrastive loss
with graph-based negative mining and structural regularization, strengthen-
ing the modelâ€™s discriminative capabilities against complex negative samples.
Experiments conducted on our self-constructed jade image dataset show that
JadeFormer achieves 82.7% Accuracy, providing robust technical support for the
digital preservation of cultural heritage.
